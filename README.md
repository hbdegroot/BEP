# BEP README

This repository contains the code used for my bachelor project in applied mathematics and applied physics in 2023. This file gives a very short introduction to some of the most important files.

The files starting with res_ are used to produce the final results. They depend on functions defined in the modules (module_sol_v1.py and module_nsol_v3.py, make sure these are in the correct directory). Some other results are obtained with files named \_tau_adjust\_. The case study results are obtained from 20230609_case_study_2_simulation.py which needs the two (unzipped) datasets in save_dir/data/ from https://rijkswaterstaatdata.nl/waterdata. Further results and figures in the appendix are made with the files dated 20230615 and 20230616. All figures in my final presentation were made with the files starting with presentatie_. Older files may contain errors.
